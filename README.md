# CS5 NSWRM Setup Files
This repository is part of OPTAIN project: https://www.optain.eu/

OPTAIN - OPtimal strategies to retAIN and re-use water and nutrients in small agricultural catchments across different soil-climatic regions in Europe (EU-funded research and innovation project, 2020-2025) proposes a social and scientific journey towards the increase and better understanding of the multiple benefits of Natural/Small Water Retention Measures (NSWRMs). But why is this important? To better adapt to extreme events that exacerbate conflicts between agricultural water uses and other human and environmental demands for water. How is that done? By elaborating from the current state of knowledge, the experience of stakeholders from 14 case studies involved in the project and innovative scientific modelling and optimization approaches. Thus OPTAIN aims to:

- Identify efficient and easy-to-implement techniques for the retention and reuse of water and nutrients in small agricultural catchments across Boreal, Continental, and Pannonian regions.

- Optimize the spatial allocation and combination of NSWRM, based on environmental and economic sustainability indicators.

## Overview

The CS5 NSWRM setup files are designed to help researchers and practitioners simulate different water resource management strategies. By configuring and running these scenarios, users can evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy individually or in combination.

## Scenarios

The repository includes setup files for five distinct scenarios:

### 1. Rotation

**Description:**  
Implements crop rotation strategies to enhance soil health, reduce pest populations, and improve water retention in the soil.

### 2. Cover Crop

**Description:**  
Utilizes cover crops to protect soil from erosion, improve soil structure, and increase water infiltration.

### 3. Pond

**Description:**  
Incorporates ponds to manage stormwater, enhance groundwater recharge, and provide habitats for wildlife.


### 4. Buffer

**Description:**  
Establishes vegetative buffer zones along water bodies to filter pollutants and reduce sediment runoff.


### 5. All Scenarios Combined

**Description:**  
Combines rotation, cover crop, pond, and buffer strategies for a comprehensive water resource management approach.

**Key Features:**
- Integrated management practices
- Maximizes benefits from individual strategies
- Holistic improvement of water quality and soil health

## Final Measurement File

- **File Name:** `CS5_pnd`  
  **Description:** This is the final measurement file generated after running simulations with the selected scenarios.
## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
